## Company and the Client

The company I worked for secured a deal with a new client who needed a storage solution for their inverters and accessories. Numerous containers had already been shipped from China to Rotterdam, and the client required a partner that wouldn’t take “no” for an answer.

<br>

Understanding the urgency, the company leveraged its network to secure a 4,000m² warehouse (likely the short version of a much bigger effort) to store the pallets of inverters.

<br>

## Containers with Inverters

There were many different types of inverters, and the packaging varied slightly. Some pallets contained 18 cartons, with each carton holding 8 inverters. This meant each pallet contained 144 inverters. Two pallets were stacked on top of each other.

<br>

In a 40ft high-cube container, a total of 40 pallets could fit, equating to 5,760 inverters per container.
